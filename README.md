# researchbuddy
Browser extension for internet research

The intent of this extension is to provide a toolkit that allows one to automate a few different research techniques when conducting research on the open internet. 

Stage 1: It will provide a popup box with an area for search terms, a selection of options, and a button to execute the search. The focus will be on google dorking techniques.

Stage 2: It will provide an option in the context menu for hiding elements of a page.
